# Target Sales Analysis

## Project Background
Target, an e-commerce retail company operating across Brazilian market since 2020, specializes in diverse product categories including health & beauty, watches, and home accessories. I'm partnering with the Sales Leadership team to analyze performance metrics and provide insights to optimize sales strategies and regional market penetration.

## Executive Summary
Target's sales analysis of 115.9K orders across 2022-2024 shows total revenue of $14.02M, with S達o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states contributing over 50% of total sales. Regional performance shows strong concentration in southeast Brazil, with S達o Paulo leading at $5.37M from 48,850 orders, while payment analysis reveals a strong preference for credit card payments with single payment installments. A significant concern is the almost 50% decline in sales at the beginning of each year. Target Brazil can strengthen its market position by optimizing complementary categories and improving payment strategies. Geographic expansion beyond the current S達o Paulo dominance will drive sustainable growth and strengthen Target Brazil's competitive position across all regions.

## Recommendations

### Seasonal Performance Enhancement:
- Launch New Year promotions and vouchers for remaining inventory after peak season.
- Schedule new product launches in early January to attract potential customers.
- Implement early Q4 preparation to maximize holiday season performance by targeting November shoppers with loyalty rewards.
- Focus on expanding top-performing product categories (Health & Beauty, Watches, Bed Bath) through increased product variety, targeted marketing campaigns, and premium offerings.

### Maximizing Regional Performance

- Leverage successful strategies from S達o Paulo to Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, focusing on increasing order volumes while maintaining the efficient low-AOV model that drives high transaction volumes.
- Create targeted strategies for high-AOV regions like Acre ($183 AOV) and Amapa ($163 AOV), focusing on premium product lines and specialized marketing to capitalize on the higher purchase power.
- Develop regional distribution centers in key growth areas to improve delivery times and reduce operational costs, particularly in regions showing potential for market expansion.
- The data suggests significant growth potential in West-Central Brazil, particularly given the higher AOVs, though infrastructure and market access challenges may need to be addressed for expansion - this needs further investigation.

### Payment Strategy Enhancement

- Strengthen credit card payment adoption in emerging regions by offering exclusive benefits and installment options, replicating the successful 77% share achieved in established markets.
- Expand the successful 10-installment plan ($292 AOV) offering across high-value product categories, while maintaining the popular single-payment option ($5.2M revenue) for routine purchases.
- Increase UPI payment adoption beyond its current 17% share by introducing region-specific incentives and improving the digital payment user experience.

## Possible Questions
What are the reasons for the consistent decline at the beginning of each year?
  - Natural reduction in shopping activity after holiday season spending.
  - Different purchasing priorities emerge with the New Year, as consumers shift focus to health and fitness goals rather than retail shopping, aligning with New Year's resolutions.
  - Consumers typically spend heavily during November ($1.75M peak) due to Black Friday promotions and continue shopping through December.
